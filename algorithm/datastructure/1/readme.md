– When the program begins, it shows a prompt.
• Enter a number:
– If user enters a number, say 10, print the number like this.
• unsorted: 10
• sorted: 10
– Then, continue to show the prompt.
• Enter a number:
– If user enters a number, say 5, then print the number like this.
• unsorted: 10 5
• sorted: 5 10
– You get the picture. As the user inputs a new number, the program prints two lines
• In the first line, the numbers are ordered by the user input.
• In the second line, the numbers are sorted in the ascending order.
– We can assume that the user will always enter a non-negative integer, and that the user
does not input more than numbers. (Duplicate inputs are allowed.)
